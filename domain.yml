        FinTech World Bank offers a wide variety of accounts beyond the standard savings and checking accounts.
        Here's a breakdown of the different categories and specific examples for  Deposit Accounts:
        
        - Certificates of Deposit (CDs): CDs offer a fixed interest rate for a set period, generally ranging from a few months to several years. 
          You receive a higher interest rate than a regular savings account in exchange for not being able to withdraw money before the term ends.
        - Money Market Accounts: These are similar to savings accounts but often have higher interest rates with certain requirements, 
          like minimum balances or limitations on withdrawals.
        - Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs): These are tax-advantaged accounts designed for retirement savings. 
          There are Traditional IRAs, Roth IRAs, and variations with specific contribution and withdrawal rules.
